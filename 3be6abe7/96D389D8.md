There have been a number of issues around `pdf-tools` installation problems on M1. `M-x pdf-tools-install` throws the following stack trace:

This happens because M1 architecture is `ARM64`, whereas the Emacs App you are using has been compiled for the `x86_64` architecture. The way to solve this problem is to install a version of Emacs which has been compiled for the M1. As of today, <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-05-09 Mon]</span></span>, the latest version of Emacs available on <https://emacsformacosx.com/> is natively compiled and you will not face these issues on it. Please remove your current Emacs App and install it from <https://emacsformacosx.com/>.

Thank you.

PS: How do I know if the Emacs I'm running has been compiled correctly?

You can see this by opening the `Activity Monitor`, selecting `Emacs`, clicking on the `Info` key, and then clicking on `Sample`. The `Code Type` field in the Sample output will show you how your Application has been compiled. Here is the output for EmacsForMacOSX (you can see that it's `ARM64`):

```text
Sampling process 61824 for 3 seconds with 1 millisecond of run time between samples
Sampling completed, processing symbols...
Analysis of sampling Emacs-arm64-11 (pid 61824) every 1 millisecond
Process:         Emacs-arm64-11 [61824]
Path:            /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs-arm64-11
Load Address:    0x1007f0000
Identifier:      org.gnu.Emacs
Version:         Version 28.1 (9.0)
Code Type:       ARM64
Platform:        macOS
```

If your Emacs is compiled for x86, the `Code Type` will be `x86_64`.
