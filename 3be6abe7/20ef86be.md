title: "PDFs are not rendering well!"

`pdf-tools` version `1.1.0` release changed the default value of `pdf-view-use-scaling` to `t` (previously, it was `nil`). This has been done keeping in mind that most modern monitors are HiDPI screens, so the default configuration should cater to this user. If you are not using a HiDPI screen, you might have to change this value to `nil` in your configuration

```elisp
(setq pdf-view-use-scaling nil)
```

to scale the images correctly when rendering them.
