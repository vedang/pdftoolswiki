Some day you might want to update this package via `git pull` and then reinstall it. Sometimes this may fail, especially if Lisp-Macros are involved and the version hasn't changed. To avoid this kind of problems, you should delete the old package via `list-packages`, restart Emacs and then reinstall the package.

This also applies when updating via package and MELPA.
