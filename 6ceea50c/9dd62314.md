Some day you might want to update this package via `git pull` and then reinstall it. Sometimes this may fail, especially if Lisp-Macros are involved and the version hasn't changed. To avoid this kind of problems, you should delete the old package via `list-packages`, restart Emacs, run `make distclean` and then reinstall the package. Follow the steps described in [[32c4fc3b|Installing pdf-tools elisp code]].

This also applies when updating via MELPA / NonGNU ELPA (except for running the `make distclean` step).
