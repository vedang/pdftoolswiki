Although not officially supported, it has been reported that `pdf-tools` work well on FreeBSD. Instead of building `pdf-tools`, you can install one of the OS packages with e.g.

```sh
$ pkg install pdf-tools-emacs26
```

To see the current list of `pdf-tools` packages for FreeBSD visit [the Repology list](https://repology.org/metapackages/?search=pdf-tools&inrepo=freebsd).

To build `pdf-tools` from either MELPA or directly from the source repository, install the dependencies with

```sh
$ pkg install autotools gmake poppler-glib
```

If you choose not to install from MELPA, you must substitute `gmake` for `make` in the instructions below.
