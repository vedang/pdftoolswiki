Although macOS is not officially supported, it has been reported that `pdf-tools` works well on macOS. You will need to install `poppler` which you can get with Homebrew via

```sh
$ brew install poppler automake
```

You will also have to help `pkg-config` find some libraries by setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, e.g.

```sh
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
```

or likewise within Emacs using `setenv`.

After that, compilation should proceed as normal.
