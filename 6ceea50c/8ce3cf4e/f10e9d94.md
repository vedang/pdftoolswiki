Although macOS is not officially supported, it has been reported that `pdf-tools` works well on macOS. You will need to install `poppler` which you can get with Homebrew via

```sh
$ brew install poppler automake
```

You will also have to help `pkg-config` find some libraries by setting `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. `brew` will show you which paths need to be added to `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` during the installation process. Make sure you export the paths to the env variable, eg:

```sh
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${PKG_CONFIG_PATH}:$(brew --prefix libffi)/lib/pkgconfig/:/usr/local/Cellar/zlib/1.2.8/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig"
```

or likewise within Emacs using `setenv`.

After that, compilation should proceed as normal.
