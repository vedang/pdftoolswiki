`pdf-tools` can be built and used on Windows using the MSYS2 compiler, or pre-built binaries can be installed in MSYS2.

The pre-built binaries will work with native (not Cygwin) Windows builds of Emacs. They include the standard binaries provided by the GNU project, those available as MSYS2 packages and numerous third-party binaries. Refer to the appropriate section under [[e305cd0a|Installing the `epdfinfo` server]] for more details.

`pdf-tools` will successfully compile using Cygwin, but it will not be able to open PDFs properly due to the way binaries compiled with Cygwin handle file paths.
