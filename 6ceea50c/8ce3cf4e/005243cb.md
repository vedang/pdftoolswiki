`pdf-tools` can be built and used on Windows using the MSYS2 compiler. This will work with native (not cygwin) Windows builds of Emacs. This includes the standard binaries provided by the GNU project, those available as MSYS2 packages and numerous third-party binaries. It has been tested with Emacs 25.1. Instructions are provided under [[d14e01ff|Compilation and installation on Window]] below. `pdf-tools` will successfully compile using Cygwin, but it will not be able to open PDFs properly due to the way binaries compiled with Cygwin handle file paths.
