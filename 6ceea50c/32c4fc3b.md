`pdf-tools` requires `tablist` package (&gt;= version 0.70) to be installed, for it to work correctly. Please make sure that the latest version of `tablist` is installed.

We have already run the steps necessary to install `pdf-tools` as part of [[e305cd0a|the server installation]]! These are:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools
$ cd /path/to/pdf-tools
$ make -s
```

If the `make` command produced the ELP file `pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar` you are fine! This package contains all the necessary files for Emacs and may be installed by either using

```sh
$ make install-package
```

or executing the Emacs command

```elisp
M-x package-install-file RET pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar RET
```

You can test if the package has been installed correctly, by running

```elisp
M-x pdf-info-check-epdfinfo RET
```

To complete the installation process, you need to activate the package by putting the code below somewhere in your `.emacs`. Alternatively, and if you care about startup time, you may want to use the loader version instead.

```elisp
(pdf-tools-install)  ; Standard activation command
(pdf-loader-install) ; On demand loading, leads to faster startup time
```

Once the Installation process is complete, check out [[19a3daea|Easy Help for PDF Tools features]] and [[8dccd685|Configuring PDF Tools features]] to get started!
