Package maintained at: <https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs-pdf-tools-server?repo=mingw64>

Users installing Emacs from the MSYS2 distribution can install pre-built binaries of the `epdfinfo` server.

1.  [Install MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and update the package database and core packages using the instructions provided.
2.  Install packages: `pacman -Ss mingw-w64-x86_64-{emacs,emacs-pdf-tools-server,imagemagick}` (ImageMagick is optional, see above.)
3.  Make sure Emacs can find `epdfinfo.exe`. Either add the MINGW install location (e.g. `C:/msys2/mingw64/bin`) to the system path with `setx PATH "C:\msys2\mingw64\bin;%PATH%"` or set Emacs's path with `(setenv "PATH" (concat "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin;" (getenv "PATH")))`. Note that libraries from other GNU utilities, such as Git for Windows, may interfere with those needed by `pdf-tools`. `pdf-info-check-epdinfo` will succeed, but errors occur when trying to view a PDF file. This can be fixed by ensuring that the MSYS libraries are always preferred.
4.  Add `(pdf-tools-install)` to your Emacs config.
