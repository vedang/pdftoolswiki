If using the GNU binaries for Windows, support for PNG and `zlib` must first be installed by copying the appropriate dlls into emacs' `bin/` directory. Most third-party binaries come with this already done.

First, install [install MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) and update the package database and core packages using the instructions provided. Then, to compile `pdf-tools` itself:

1.  Open msys2 shell
2.  Update and install dependencies, skipping any you already have

<!--listend-->

```sh
$ pacman -Syu
$ pacman -S base-devel
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-poppler
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick
```

1.  Install `pdf-tools` in Emacs, but do not try to compile the server. Instead, get a separate copy of the source somewhere else.

<!--listend-->

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools
```

1.  Open `mingw64` shell (**Note:** You must use `mingw64.exe` and not `msys2.exe`)
2.  Compile pdf-tools

<!--listend-->

```sh
$ cd /path/to/pdf-tools
$ make -s
```

1.  This should produce a file `server/epdfinfo.exe`. Copy this file into the `pdf-tools/` installation directory in your Emacs.
2.  Start Emacs and activate the package.

<!--listend-->

```nil
M-x pdf-tools-install RET
```

1.  Test.

<!--listend-->

```nil
M-x pdf-info-check-epdfinfo RET
```

If this is successful, `(pdf-tools-install)` can be added to Emacs' config. Note that libraries from other GNU utilities, such as Git for Windows, may interfere with those needed by `pdf-tools`. `pdf-info-check-epdinfo` will succeed, but errors occur when trying to view a PDF file. This can be fixed by ensuring that the MSYS libraries are always preferred in Emacs:

```emacs-lisp
(setenv "PATH" (concat "C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin;" (getenv "PATH")))
```
