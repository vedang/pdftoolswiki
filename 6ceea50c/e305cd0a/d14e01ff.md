If using the GNU binaries for Windows, support for PNG and `zlib` must first be installed by copying the appropriate dlls into emacs' `bin/` directory. Most third-party binaries come with this already done.

First, [install MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and update the package database and core packages using the instructions provided. Then, to compile `pdf-tools` itself:

1.  Open msys2 shell
2.  Update and install dependencies, skipping any you already have

    ```sh
    $ pacman -Syu
    $ pacman -S base-devel
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libpng
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-poppler
    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick
    ```
3.  Install `pdf-tools` in Emacs, but do not try to compile the server. Instead, get a separate copy of the source somewhere else.

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools
    ```
4.  Open `mingw64` shell (**Note:** You must use `mingw64.exe` and not `msys2.exe`)
5.  Compile pdf-tools

    ```sh
    $ cd /path/to/pdf-tools
    $ make -s
    ```
6.  This should produce a file `server/epdfinfo.exe`. Copy this file into the `pdf-tools/` installation directory in your Emacs.
7.  Start Emacs and activate the package.

    ```nil
    M-x pdf-tools-install RET
    ```
8.  Test.

    ```nil
    M-x pdf-info-check-epdfinfo RET
    ```

If this is successful, `(pdf-tools-install)` can be added to Emacs' config. See the note on how to set up PATH in the previous section.
