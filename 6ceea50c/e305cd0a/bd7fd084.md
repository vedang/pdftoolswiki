title: "Compiling and Installing the epdfinfo server from source on Linux"

Note that this is the only officially supported method for installing the `epdfinfo` binary. Instructions:

```sh
$ cd /path/to/pdf-tools
$ make -s
```

This should compile the source code and create a Emacs Lisp Package in the root directory of the project. The configure script also tells you at the very end, which features, depending on the `libpoppler` version, will be available. These commands should give no error, otherwise you are in trouble.
