If you install `pdf-tools` via NonGNU ELPA or MELPA, **you don't need to worry about this separate server installation at all**. However, if you have a non-standard installation, please refer to the links below for installing `epdfinfo` server prerequisites.

Note: You'll need GNU Emacs &ge; 26.1 and some form of a GNU/Linux OS. Other operating systems are not officially supported, but `pdf-tools` is known to work on many of them.

Similarly, package-managers are not officially supported, but `pdf-tools` is known to be available on some of them. See the section on [[fb5cef15|Installing the `epdfinfo` server from package managers]] to avoid manual installation of server / server prerequisites.

See the section on [[A34704B9|I want to add support for `pdf-tools` on `My Fav OS`. How do I do that?]] to add your favorite Operating System to this list.
