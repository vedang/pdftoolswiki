title: "Add a Dockerfile to automate server compilation testing"
author: ["Vedang Manerikar"]
draft: false

The `server/test/docker` folder contains Dockerfile templates used for testing that the `epdfinfo` server compiles correctly on various operating systems ([[5327945D|more details here]]).

To see the list of operating systems where compilation testing is supported, run `make server-test-supported`. To see the list of operating systems where testing is unsupported, run `make server-test-unsupported`. To add support, look into the `server/test/docker/templates` folder (`ubuntu` files are a good example to refer to)
