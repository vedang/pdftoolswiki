You can go to the `pdf-tools` folder and run `make server-test` to check if the changes you have made to the server code break compilation on any of the supported operating systems.

The tests build `Podman` images for all supported operating systems, so you will have to install `Podman` first, if you don't have already. You can install `Podman` by following the instructions on their site at <https://podman.io/getting-started/installation>

Podman is compatible with Docker, so if you already have `docker` installed, you should be able to `alias podman=docker` on your shell and run the tests, without having to install Docker. (Note: I have not tested this)
