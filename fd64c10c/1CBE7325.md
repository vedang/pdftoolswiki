You can go to the `pdf-tools` folder and run `make test` to run the ERT tests and check if the changes you have made to the code break any of the tests.

The tests are written in ERT, which is the built-in testing system in Emacs. However, they are run using `Cask` which you will have to install first, if you don't have it already. You can install `Cask` by following the instructions on their site at <https://github.com/cask/cask>
