title: "Text selection is not transparent in PDFs OCRed with Tesseract"

In such PDFs the selected text becomes hidden behind the selection; see [this issue](https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools/issues/149), which also describes the workaround in detail. The following function, which depends on the [qpdf.el](https://github.com/orgtre/qpdf.el) package, can be used to convert such a PDF file into one where text selection is transparent:

```elisp
(defun my-fix-pdf-selection ()
  "Replace pdf with one where selection shows transparently."
  (interactive)
  (unless (equal (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)) "pdf")
    (error "Buffer should visit a pdf file."))
  (unless (equal major-mode 'pdf-view-mode)
    (pdf-view-mode))
  ;; save file in QDF-mode
  (qpdf-run (list
             (concat "--infile="
                     (buffer-file-name))
             "--qdf --object-streams=disable"
             "--replace-input"))
  ;; do replacements
  (text-mode)
  (read-only-mode -1)
  (while (re-search-forward "3 Tr" nil t)
    (replace-match "7 Tr" nil nil))
  (save-buffer)
  (pdf-view-mode))
```

Note that this overwrites the PDF file visited in the buffer from which it is run! To avoid this replace the `--replace-input` with `(concat "--outfile=" (file-truename (read-file-name "Outfile: ")))`.
