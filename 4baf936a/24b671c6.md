Autorevert works by polling the file-system every `auto-revert-interval` seconds, optionally combined with some event-based reverting via [file notification](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/elisp/File-Notifications.html). But this currently does not work reliably, such that Emacs may revert the PDF-buffer while the corresponding file is still being written to (e.g. by LaTeX), leading to a potential error.

With a recent [AUCTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/) installation, you might want to put the following somewhere in your dotemacs, which will revert the PDF-buffer **after** the TeX compilation has finished.

```emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'TeX-after-compilation-finished-functions #'TeX-revert-document-buffer)
```
